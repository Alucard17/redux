# PubNub Redux SDK

The PubNub Client SDKs are designed for transmitting realtime data over PubNub’s Data Stream Network, and Redux is designed for managing client application state. The PubNub Redux SDK bridges these two client libraries to provide the capability to manage data transmitted using PubNub inside of applications using Redux. The Redux SDK allows PubNub-defined data to coexist with customer-defined data.

The Redux SDK is an npm module that provides Redux-specific functions which can be integrated with the user’s existing, or new, Redux data store.
